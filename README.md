# OpenLib

**OpenLib** is a highly reusable JavaScript framework designed to help teams build scalable, consistent, and maintainable systems—without rewriting the same logic again and again.

> **Build once. Reuse everywhere.**

## 🚀 Why OpenLib?

Modern JavaScript projects often suffer from:
- Repeated utility logic across apps  
- Inconsistent patterns between teams  
- Tight coupling between features  
- Hard-to-scale architectures  

**OpenLib solves this by providing a structured, composable, and reusable foundation** that works across frameworks, platforms, and project sizes.

## DX - Developer Experience

**DX is how pleasant a framework is to work with — but it should never lie about what actually happens at runtime.
